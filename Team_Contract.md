# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our group will aim to meet at least once a week, with each meeting lasting at least an hour. We are going 
    to try our best to meet in person (at least until turkey break), and we will use zoom to meet over break. 
    For zoom, we will record meetings, and for in person, we will document our progress each time we meet, 
    as well as write down goals we have for the group before the next time we meet as well. 
    
2. **Assistance** 
    We have created a group IMessage/SMS chat, and it is expected that any questions/ communication in that chat 
    WILL be responded to within 24 hours. This group chat is where we will set up times to meet every week as well, 
    and get opinions on code that has been written, or documentation that has been recorded. 
    
3. **Respect** 
    We will make sure that every team member's ideas are heard. We will not interrupt others, or put others in our group 
    down for any idea they have. If we think that the idea could be better or improved, we will convey this is a noninsulting, but direct way. 
    If we do not like someone else's idea, or feel threatened by another idea in the group, we will also convey this is a clear, calm and concise way. 
    It is easy to let ego get in the way of a coding project, and our group has decided to avoid this by making sure that for every decision that is made along the way, 
    that decision is discussed with each and every member of the group, and each member is able to share their thoughts on it. We will also not change anything behind people's backs-- 
    if we are going to change something in the documentation or code, we will let the other people in the group know about it, especially if they had already worked on it. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    In order to assign who is doing what during this final project, we will have a structured outline everytime we meet. When we meet, we will go over what we have accomplished in the last week, 
    and go over what needs to be done in the following week. We will lay out our schedules, and be open if we have a busy week. After having done these 3 things, we will give our preferences about 
    what we would like to personally work on, before coming to a compromise and finalizing work for the week as a team to make sure our weekly goals are hit.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    It is expected that each group member commits 6 hours of work to this final project a week before thanksgiving break, and at least 10 hours a week over break, since we will have more time to focus on the project. 
    This is on average, an hour each day, and maybe 2 hours a day over break, so as a team, we agreed that this is completely fair, and doable for all of our schedules. It is estimated that it will take our group 30-35 hours 
    per person to complete this project, so on this layout, we have planned to get this project done by the end of thanksgiving break, which is ambitious, but should be accomplished. If we feel that someone is not putting in enough time, 
    this will be discussed as a team, and we will explore reasons that this is happening. If someone has a busy week, it is expected that they make up the work when they can, but there is a reason we set things up the way that we did-- we 
    believe an hour commitment every day for a month is completely reasonable in order to get this project finished. 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If there is a disagreement or conflict in the group, it will be DISCUSSED, and not blocked out. It will be discussed in a respectful and clear way, such that each group member can clearly understand what the problem is, why it is happening and how 
    to resolve it. If we need to reassign work, we will do it as a team. If we need to change something in our project, we will do so, as a team. If we have a problem with people in our group, we will resolve this, AS A TEAM. In order to avoid further conflicts 
    (if one were to happen in the first place), we have decided that it would be best to not exclude people from a the conversation about the problem, even if it doesn't directly involve them. This is how we would like our team to operate, and we believe that this 
    will prevent any serious conflicts from developing, as well as stifle any conflicts that do arise.
