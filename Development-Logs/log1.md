# Development Log (Date: 10/31/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
    - Work on project proposal, and turn in by November 3rd. 
    - Start drawing up ways to pipeline our data once we are done with the project proposal. 
    - Implement the core data structure for our code 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    - Mankeerat will work on the Data Acquisition and processing section of the project proposal, 
    and will have it drafted before the end of November 2nd. 
    - David will work on the leading question, as well as the overall timeline for the duration of the project. 
    He will also attach the project proposal and team contract to the group github by the end of November 2nd. 
    - Jason will write out the graph algorithm portion of our project proposal, and will describe the algorithms 
    that we will be using by the end of November 2nd. 
    - We will meet to review our changes on November 3rd before submitting our project proposal. 

## Problems Encountered 
    - Had to come up with a new plan for how we were going to store the reviews in our BTree, as well as restructure 
    what algorithms we were going to use on our tree. 

## Plans for next week
    - Finish the core data structure implementation for our code, as well as the first algorithm of choice that we learned 
    in class (we are thinking BFS at this point in time, but this is subject to change)
    - Meet with mentor again to go over progress and tests that have been passed for our first implementation. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
