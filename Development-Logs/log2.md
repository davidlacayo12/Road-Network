# Development Log (Date: 11/04/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
    - Work on redesigning our project proposal within the next couple of days 
        (and definitely by the end of the week. We need to think about how we are 
        going to take a different tree and turn it into a graph, since BTrees will 
        not work for this. We also need to pick different algorithms, since we only 
        picked one of the ones taught in class instead of 2. 
    - Now that it is make or break, finish up the data structure with the BFS of simple data, 
    and parse the data that we are going to use in our final project. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    - Mankeerat will work on the Data processing and allowing us to use the data from 
        Amazon Food reviews in our final project.
    - David will work on the finishing the BFS and the data structure with simple data, 
        and document the progress so far. 
    - Jason will rewrite out the graph algorithm portion of our project proposal, since 
        we need 2 algoritms taught in class instead of 1.
    - We will meet to review our changes on November 11th before 
        resubmitting our project proposal. 

## Problems Encountered 
    - Had to come up with a new plan for how we were going to store the reviews in a tree, 
        as well as restructure what algorithms we were going to use on our tree, since BTrees 
        are going to be difficult to accomplish what we want to accomplish. 
        
## Plans for next week
    - Finish BFS on our real final project Amazon data, and start implementing the 
        remaining 2 algorithms.
    - Start implementing our recommendation part of the project. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
