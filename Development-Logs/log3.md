# Development Log (Date: 11/11/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
    - Get working on the graph implementation for our new project proposal. 
    
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
    - Mankeerat will finish processing the data set on the road network of roads between locations in North America 
    - David will start working on the graph implementation of the road network dataset. Will also start running tests with simple data for the 
    construction of the graph, as well as start working on the shortest path algorithm and testing it with that simple data before using the full dataset.   
    - Jason will work on the BFS implementation of the graph, as well as the construction of the graph based on the road network given. 
    - We will meet before the end of this week with either our mentor, or with the whole group to discuss meeting dates over break, as well as tasks 
    that we would like to 100% accomplish before we return.  
    
## Problems Encountered 
    - Decided we would need to change our implementation-- dataset we chose was not weighted, so there would be no way to do a shortest path-- that 
    would be a BFS anyway, so it is pointless. Decided to switch datasets and change our implementation to a graph. 
    
## Plans for next week
    - Finish the graph implementation for our road network, and complete at least 2 of the algorithms with our dataset with clear documentation   
## Optional: Questions for mentor
